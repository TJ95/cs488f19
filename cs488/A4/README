CS488 - Fall 2019 Assignment 4
Tianjun Zhang, 20643273, t269zhan@uwaterloo.ca

Compilation:
	- no changes to the default premake/make commands
	- tested on lab computer gl29

Manual:
	- Bounding Volumes are off by default, UN-COMMENT line 17 in Mesh.cpp to activate
	- Extra feature: Anti-aliasing via super-sampling is OFF by default,
	  * UN-COMMENT line 13 in A4.hpp to activate
	  * AA slows down rendering by quite a bit
	  * Comparision screenshots via hier.lua are available in Assets/hier_AA
	- Due to pressing time limitations no novel scene was made, had some really cool ideas in mind,
	  hoping to get the 9/10 so I don't flop my project proposal
	- screenshot.png is a 1024 by 1024 version of nonhier
	- screenshots generated during testing are stored in Assets/ as well
